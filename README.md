<h1> About-me</h1>
My name is Luke Mersh.<br>

<main>
I am a self-taught freelance Wordpress developer.<br>
I have started this page to help guide me and give me some starting point and focus on my journey.<br>
Not sure where to start, I read about creating a kind of portfolio come showcase of my work on GitHub.
I am in the process of creating my website, but I am still working on it, so for now I will be uploading and practice files and work into my portfolio.
